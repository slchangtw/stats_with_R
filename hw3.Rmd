```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, comment = "", fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(knitr)

```

```{r}
load("data/creditcard.Rdata")
```

## 1. First of all, tabulate the CreditCard variable.

### (a) (half a point) How many applicants was the credit card approved?

```{r}
table(creditcard$CreditCard)
```
The credit card was approved for 307 applicants.

### (b) (1 point) What are the odds of getting a credit card application denied?

```{r}
383 / 307
```
The odds of getting a credit card application denied is 1.247557

### (c) (1 point) What is the "risk" (i.e. probability) of getting a credit card application approved?

```{r}
307 / (383 + 307)
```
The risk of getting a credit card approved is 0.4449275

## 2. Cross-tabulate the variables Children and CreditCard.

### (a) (1 point) How many applicants with children in their household was the credit card denied?

The credit card denied for 170 applicants with children in their household.

```{r}
table(creditcard$Children, creditcard$CreditCard)
```

### (b) (1 point) How many applicants without children in their household got the credit card application approved?

161

```{r}
xtabs(~ creditcard$Children + creditcard$CreditCard)
```
The credit card application approved for 161 applicants without children in their household. 

### (c) (half a point) Draw a mosaicplot visualising the contingency table of credit card approval and whether children live in the applicant’s household.

```{r}
mosaicplot(CreditCard ~ Children, data = creditcard, color = 2:3)
```


## 3. You continue with your analysis of the relationship between Children and CreditCard.

### (a) (1 point) Are applicants with children in their household less likely (as measured in odds) to get credit card applications approved than others? Calculate the odds ratio for getting a credit card application approved comparing applicants with children in their household with those without.

```{r}
(146 / 170) / (161 / 213)

# or 
oddsratio(xtabs(~ creditcard$Children + creditcard$CreditCard), log = FALSE)
```
The odds of getting a credit card application approved comparing applicants with children in their household with those without is 1.136208

### (b) (1 point) Are applicants with children less likely (as measured in risk) to get credit card applications denied than applicants without children? Calculate the relative risk for getting a credit card application denied comparing applicants with children in their household to those without.

```{r}
(213 / (213 + 161)) / (170 / (170 + 146))
```
The risk for getting a credit card application denied comparing applicants with children in their household to those without is 1.058635

### (c) (half a point) Looking at the mosiac plot created in Question 2c, how strong is the relationship between the two variables Children and CreditCard.

```{r}
mosaicplot(CreditCard ~ Children, data = creditcard, color = 2:3)
```
Based on the mosaicpot the created in question 2c, the relationship between the two variables Children and CreditCard is not that strong.

## 4. Now, you assess the relationship between Children and CreditCard using the $\chi^2$-statistic.

### (a) (1 point) Calculate the $\chi^2$-statistic to assess the relationship between Children and CreditCard.

```{r}
chisq.test(creditcard$Children, creditcard$CreditCard)$statistics
```
The chi^2$-statistic is 0.56827.

### (b) (1.5 points) Calculate the expected frequencies under the assumption that home ownership has no effect on credit card approval. For which cells are expected frequencies higher than the observed ones?

```{r}
xtabs(~creditcard$HomeOwner + creditcard$CreditCard)
chisq.test(creditcard$HomeOwner, creditcard$CreditCard)$expected
```
For cell representing non Homeowners who got credit card approved and for home owners who got the credit card denied the expected frequencies are higher than the observed ones as shown in the table below.

```{r}
chisq.test(creditcard$Children, creditcard$CreditCard)$expected > xtabs(~ creditcard$Children + creditcard$CreditCard)
```

## 5. In the following, perform the analyses separately for female and male applicants.

```{r}
creditcard_f <- creditcard[creditcard$Gender == 0, ]
creditcard_m <- creditcard[creditcard$Gender == 1, ]
```

### (a) (half a point) Calculate the $\chi^2$-statistic to assess the relationship between Children and CreditCard.

```{r}
chisq.test(creditcard_f$Children, creditcard_f$CreditCard)
chisq.test(creditcard_f$Children, creditcard_f$CreditCard)$statistic
```
Chi-squared statistic for the relationship between males with Children and CreditCard is 1.0837

```{r}
chisq.test(creditcard_m$Children, creditcard_m$CreditCard)
chisq.test(creditcard_m$Children, creditcard_m$CreditCard)$statistic
```
Chi-squared statistic for the relationship between females with Children and CreditCard is 3.033659

### (b) (1.5 point) Calculate the expected frequencies under the assumption that Children has no effect on credit card approval. For which cells are expected frequencies higher than the observed ones?

```{r}

chisq.test(creditcard_f$Children, creditcard_f$CreditCard)$expected
chisq.test(creditcard_f$Children, creditcard_f$CreditCard)$expected > xtabs(~creditcard_f$Children + creditcard_f$CreditCard)
xtabs(~creditcard_f$Children + creditcard_f$CreditCard)
```
The expected frequencies under the assumption that females with Children have no effect on credit card approval is shown in the first table. 
For cells representing females with no children, credit card denied and credit card approved and children have frequencies higher than the observed ones


```{r}
chisq.test(creditcard_m$Children, creditcard_m$CreditCard)$expected
chisq.test(creditcard_m$Children, creditcard_m$CreditCard)$expected > xtabs(~ creditcard_m$Children + creditcard_m$CreditCard)
xtabs(~ creditcard_m$Children + creditcard_m$CreditCard)
```
The expected frequencies under the assumption that males with Children have no effect on credit card approval is shown in the first table. 
For cells representing male with children, credit card approved and credit card denied and with children have frequencies higher than the observed ones

### (c) (half a point) Do the results differ for the two sexes?
Yes the results differ for the two sexes as shown in the above tables.

## 6. (2.5 points) Visualise the relationships using mosaicplots. Do the differences between females and males in relation to credit card approval and children in the household become visible in the plots? Provide reason for your answer!

```{r}
mosaicplot(CreditCard ~ Children + Gender, data = creditcard, color = 2:5)
```
Yes the differences between females and males in relation to credit card approval and children in the household becomes visible in the plots. We see that for male applicants with house holds who have children the credit card denied is lower than for female with households having children whose credit card application was denied.


## 7. (2.5points) Compute the odds ratios to assess the relationship between Children and CreditCard for males and females separately. Are the results more in line with the $\chi^2$-statistic or more in line with the mosaicplot?

```{r}
oddsratio(xtabs(~ creditcard_f$Children + creditcard_f$CreditCard), log = FALSE)
```

```{r}
oddsratio(xtabs(~ creditcard_m$Children + creditcard_m$CreditCard), log = FALSE)
```
The results are more in line with mosaicplot

## 8. Now, you assess the relationships between SavingsType and CreditCard.

### (a) (half a point) Calculate the $\chi^2$-statistic to assess the relationship between SavingsType and CreditCard.

```{r}
chisq.test(creditcard$SavingsType, creditcard$CreditCard)
chisq.test(creditcard$SavingsType, creditcard$CreditCard)$statistic
```
The chi squared  statistic for relationship between SavingsType and Creditcard is 9.19157

### (b) (1 point) Calculate the Phi-coefficient, the Contingency Coefficient and Cramer’s V to assess the relationship between SavingsType and CreditCard.

```{r}

# phi(table(creditcard$SavingsType, creditcard$CreditCard)) # cannot be calculated, since the size of contigency table is not 2 x 2 

relation <- list("Contingency Coefficient" = 
ContCoef(x = creditcard$SavingsType, y = creditcard$CreditCard),
"Cramer's V" = CramerV(x = creditcard$SavingsType, y = creditcard$CreditCard))

relation
```
The calculated values are as below:
Contingency Coefficient: 0.114656
Cramer’s V : 0.1154171

### (c) (half a point) Why is there no result for the Phi-Coefficient?
Since the size of contigency table is not 2 x 2, there is no result for Phi-coefficient.

### (d) (half a point) Visualize the relationship between credit card approval and savings type. Which of the statistics used for this data comes closer to the visual representation of the relationship’s strength?

```{r}
mosaicplot(CreditCard ~ SavingsType, data = creditcard, color = 2:3)
```
Spearmen corelation comes close to he visual representation of the relationship´s strength.

## 9. (2.5 points) Since there are too few cases for savings type 3 (CDs), you exclude applicants having this savings type and re-run the analysis of Question 8 again. Summarize the results and comment on the differences.

```{r}
# remove savings type 3
creditcard_remove_3 <- creditcard[!creditcard$SavingsType == 3, ]
```

```{r}
chisq.test(creditcard_remove_3$SavingsType, creditcard_remove_3$CreditCard)
```
```{r}
relation <- list("Phi-coefficient" = phi(table(creditcard_remove_3$SavingsType, creditcard_remove_3$CreditCard)),
                 "Contingency Coefficient" = 
ContCoef(x = creditcard_remove_3$SavingsType, y = creditcard_remove_3$CreditCard),
"Cramer's V" = CramerV(x = creditcard_remove_3$SavingsType, y = creditcard_remove_3$CreditCard))

relation
```
```{r}
mosaicplot(CreditCard ~ SavingsType, data = creditcard_remove_3, color = 2:3)
```
after removing savings type 3 the following values are obtained 

`Chi-squared statistic` is  = 7.3615
`Phi-coefficient` is 0.11
`Contingency Coefficient` is 0.1085816
`Cramer's V`is 0.1092274

We see that the chi-squared value has reduced from 9.19 to 7.36
Contigency coefficient has not changed from 0.114656 to 0.1085816
cramer´s V has changed from 0.1154171 to 0.1092274
