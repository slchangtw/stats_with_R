11. You continue investigating the relationship between price change over the
last 12 months and dividend. From the revious question you conclude that there
are five outliers: two companies with high dividend, three with high price change.
(a) (half a point) Eliminate these five outliers and draw the plot anew. Has the relationship
changed? 
Yes, the relationship has changed, as the outliers have been removed.

(b) (1 point) Give the company names for those that you eliminated from your analysis?
The five commpanies that we eleminated are as below 
"IDB Holdings", "Brait SA. (JSE)", "Combined Motor", "Peregrine" and "PSG Group"

(c) (1 point) Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient for the restricted set. By how much
has the correlation coefficient changed.

with the complete set:
cor(companies$pricechange, companies$dividend, use = "complete.obs", method = "pearson")
[1] -0.130151

with the restricted set:
d <- companies[!(companies$dividend > 15 | companies$pricechange > 140), ]
cor(d$pricechange, d$dividend, use = "complete.obs", method = "pearson")
[1] -0.3311798
The co relation co efficient for the restricted set has changed by 0.2010288.
